### DISCLAIMER
The need for this Piece of Software was the lack of possibilitys to stack graphical Elements in to make clipping masks and the likes in Adobe PDF Forms. This code is hacky and full of worst pratice examples, in case you need some inspiration on **how-not-to-do** stuff go ahead and dig in. I do not take pride in anything but the fact that this overengineered mess seems to the untrained eye to be working. I shall not be heald accountable for any casualties, may they be material or immaterial.

### Rules
Templates are produced with Adobe Illustrator and saved as SVG, after that they shouldnt be touched, all of the manipilation is handeld by jquery and Javasript. For this to work the SVG has to be fitted with the correct **id** Attributes in Illustrator.
